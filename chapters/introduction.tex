This thesis investigates a numerical approximation method put forth by
Baxter in 1978 \cite{baxter1978variational, baxter1982exactly_ctm,
tsang1979square} based on the corner transfer matrix formulation of the
partition function for two-dimensional classical lattice models with
a round-a-face interaction. 

The method rose to prominence in 1996, under the name \emph{corner
transfer matrix renormalization group} (CTMRG), when Nishino showed
\cite{nishino1996corner} that in the thermodynamic limit, it is equivalent
to the hugely successful density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
method for one-dimensional quantum systems \cite{white1992density},
discovered a few years earlier by White.

The error in the CTMRG method comes from the fact that the corner transfer
matrices, whose dimension diverges exponentially in the lattice size, have
to be truncated at a maximum size $m$ in order to make numerical
manipulation possible. This finite \emph{bond dimension} $m$ introduces
finite-size effects, comparable to those observed for systems that are
finite in one or more spatial dimensions. This was already realized by
Nishino \cite{nishino1996numerical}.

The main objective of this thesis is to study how \emph{finite bond
dimension scaling} may be performed with the CTMRG method.

Before the structure of this thesis is laid out, I will first make some
general remarks on statistical mechanics and phase transitions, and on how
the CTMRG method relates to the class of methods for simulating many-body
systems that grew out of White's breakthrough, known as \emph{tensor
network algorithms}.

\section{Phase transitions}
Statistical mechanics is concerned with describing the average properties
of systems consisting of many particles. Examples of such systems are the
atoms making up a bar magnet, the water molecules in a glass of water, or
virtually any other instance of matter around us.

Matter can arrange itself in various structures with fundamentally
different properties. We call these distinct states of matter
\emph{phases}. When matter changes from one phase to another, we say it
undergoes a phase transition.

Physics has made great strides in understanding these transitions. The
complete history of the field is beyond the scope of this introduction and this
thesis, but the reader may wish to consult \cite{kadanoff2009more,
domb1996critical} to get an idea.

Only as late as 1936, the occurrence of a phase transition
within the framework of statistical physics was established by R. Peierls
\cite{peierls1936on_ising}. He showed that the two-dimensional Ising model
has a non-zero magnetization for sufficiently low temperatures. Since for
high enough temperatures the Ising model loses its magnetization, it
follows that there must be phase transition in between.

The effort to understand the Ising model culminated with Onsager's exact
solution in 1944 \cite{onsager1944two_dimensional}, which rigorously
established a sharp transition point in the thermodynamic limit.

One may question the relevance of studying very simple models such as the
Ising model. As it turns out, systems that are at first sight vastly
different may show qualitatively similar behaviour near a phase
transition. For example, exponents that characterize the divergence of
quantities near a transition are conjectured to be independent on
microscopic details of the interactions between particles, but instead
fall into distinct \emph{universality classes}
\cite{griffiths1970dependence, fisher1966quantum}. Thus, studying the very
simplest model may yield universal results.

\section{Baxter's method as a precursor to tensor network methods}

Baxter showed that the optimal truncation of corner transfer matrices
corresponds, in the thermodynamic limit, to a variational optimization of
the row-to-row transfer matrix within a certain subspace, now known as the
subspace of \emph{matrix product states} (MPSs) \cite{baxter1968dimers,
baxter1982exactly_ctm}.

After the success of White's DMRG, which, as Nishino showed, is equivalent
to Baxter's method, the underlying matrix-product structure was
rediscovered in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems by Östlund
and Rommer \cite{ostlund1995thermodynamic, rommer1997class}.

It is historically significant but little known that Nightingale, in
a footnote of a 1986 paper \cite{nightingale1986gap}, already made the
remark that \enquote{The generalization [of Baxter's method] to quantum
mechanical systems is straightforward.}

After Östlund and Rommer, it was realized that reformulating White's
algorithm directly in terms of matrix product states provided the
explanation of the algorithm's shortcomings around phase transitions. An
MPS-ansatz fundamentally limits the entropy of the ground state
approximation and since the entropy diverges at a conformally invariant
critical point \cite{calabrese2004entanglement}, DMRG gives inaccurate
results.

This gave rise to other ansätze, formulated in the language of tensor
networks \cite{orus2014practical}, specifically designed to represent
states with a certain amount of entropy. Examples are multi-scale
entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) for critical one-dimensional
quantum systems \cite{vidal2007entanglement} and projected entangled-pair
states (PEPS) \cite{verstraete2004renormalization}
for two-dimensional quantum systems.

Other tensor network algorithms, such as infinite time-evolving block
decimation \cite{vidal2007classical} in one dimension and iPEPS (infinite
PEPS) \cite{jordan2008classical} in two dimensions, made it possible to
directly approximate quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit.



\section{Structure of this thesis}

It is in the mostly quantum-oriented context sketched above that the
research for this thesis was carried out. Therefore, I have chosen to
begin by introducing White's algorithm in its original description
(chapter two), before making the connection to two-dimensional classical
lattices and properly introducing the corner transfer matrix formulation
(chapter three).

Chapter four introduces the concepts of critical behaviour and finite-size
scaling and chapter five 



% We investigate finite-size scaling behaviour in two-dimensional classical systems using
% the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Instead of scaling in the
% system size $N$, we perform a scaling analysis in the bond dimension -- or numbers of
% basis states kept -- in approximating the corner transfer matrix of the system. This
% dimension is denoted $m$, though in other works it may appear as $\chi$ or $D$.
%
% This thesis is laid out as follows. Chapter two introduces the density matrix
% renormalization group (DMRG) method in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems.
% Since most of the literature and research focuses on quantum lattice models, it is helpful
% to keep this picture in mind.
%
% Chapter three explains how the ideas of DMRG can be applied to two-dimensional classical
% lattices. After making this connection clear, the corner transfer matrix
% renormalization group (CTMRG) method, a unification of DMRG and earlier ideas from Baxter, is introduced.
%
% Chapter four introduces the concepts of critical behaviour and finite-size scaling,
% while chapter five makes the connection to finite-size effects that appear as a consequence of a finite bond dimension
% $m$ within the CTMRG method.
%
% Chapter six describes implementation details and convergence behaviour of the CTMRG algorithm.
% Chapter seven presents numerical results of finite-$m$ scaling for the Ising model.
%
% Chapter eight introduces the clock model and the basic concepts of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition,
% presents results of finite-$m$ scaling and compares with works using other numerical methods.
