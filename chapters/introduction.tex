We investigate finite-size scaling behaviour in two-dimensional classical systems using
the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Instead of scaling in the
system size $N$, we perform a scaling analysis in the bond dimension -- or numbers of
basis states kept -- in approximating the corner transfer matrix of the system. This
dimension is denoted by $\chi$ or $m$.

This thesis is laid out as follows. Chapter one introduces the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems.
Since most of the literature and research focuses on quantum lattice models, it is helpful
to keep this picture in mind.

Chapter two explains how the ideas of DMRG can be applied to two-dimensional classical
lattices. After making this connection clear, we describe the corner transfer matrix
renormalization group method, and apply it to the Ising model.

Chapter three introduces the concepts of critical behaviour and finite-size scaling.

Results are presented in chapter four.

\todo[inline]{
Maybe it's better to start with a chapter on statistical mechanics (introducing transfer
matrices, computing quantities, etc), then a chapter on critical behaviour and finite-size
scaling, and THEN a chapter that introduces DMRG, TMRG and CTMRG in one go.
