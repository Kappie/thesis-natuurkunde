We present finite-size scaling results using the corner transfer matrix renormalization
group method on two-dimensional classical square lattices \cite{nishino1996corner}. We
compare the results of conventional finite-size scaling in the system size $N$ with
scaling in the number of states kept during the renormalization step of the algorithm,
denoted by $m$. Such a comparison was first done in \cite{nishino1996numerical}. We
highlight the areas in which method excels over the other.

Calculate critical temperature and exponents using information that is directly
extractable from the corner transfer matrix.


\section{Introduction}

The first direct comparison of finite-size scaling in the system size $N$ with scaling in
the bond dimension of the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method $m$ was done
in \cite{nishino1996numerical}. In explaining the basic concepts, we largely follow this
paper.

The error in the approximation of the partition function (and thus all thermodynamic
quantities) in the thermodynamic limit with the corner transfer matrix method depends on
two characteristic length
scales. The first is the size of the system $N$. After $n$ steps of the infinite-system
algorithm, we have
\begin{equation}
  N = 2n + 1.
\end{equation}

The second length scale is related to the finite bond dimension $m$. Baxter
\cite{baxter1978variational}, and later Ã–stlund and Rommer \cite{ostlund1995thermodynamic}
(in the context of one-dimensional quantum systems) showed that in the thermodynamic
limit, CTMRG and DMRG are variational optimizations in the space of matrix product states.

\end{figure}

It is known that an MPS-ansatz with finite bond dimension inherently limits the
correlation length of the system to a finite value \cite{wolf2006quantum}. Hence,
thermodynamic quantities obtained from the CTMRG algorithm with finite $m$, in the limit
$N \to \infty$, cannot diverge and must show finite-size effects similar to those of some
effective finite system of size $N_{\text{eff}}(m)$ depending on the bond dimension $m$.

\autoref{fig:order_parameter_vs_T} shows the behaviour of the order parameter of the
two-dimensional Ising model for systems of finite-size, where $m$ has been chosen such
that the truncation error is smaller than $10^{-6}$, and for systems of finite $m$, where
the result is converged in the system size $N$. The results look very similar and support
the above claim.

In the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite $m$ and $N$), we have the following
expression for the correlation length of a classical system
\cite{baxter1982exactly_correlation_length}
\begin{equation}
  \xi(T) = \frac{1}{\log\left(\frac{T_0}{T_1}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Here, $T_0$ and $T_1$ are the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the row-to-row
transfer matrix $T$, respectively. With $N$ tending towards infinity and finite $m$, near
the critical point $\xi(T)$ should obey a scaling law of the form
\begin{equation}
  \xi(T, m) = N_{\text{eff}}(m) \mathcal{F}(\frac{N_{\text{eff}}(m)}{\xi(T)})
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}(x) = \begin{cases}
      \text{const} & \text{if } x \to 0, \\
      x^{-1} & \text{if } x \to \infty.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Hence, the effective length scale corresponding to the finite bond dimension $m$ is
proportional to the correlation length of the system at the critical point $t = 0$.
\begin{equation}
  N_{\text{eff}}(m) \propto \xi(T = T_c, m).
\end{equation}

To test this assumption, the authors of \cite{nishino1996numerical} propose a scaling
relation for the order parameter $M$ at the critical temperature of the form
\begin{equation}
  M(N, m) = N^{-\beta/\nu} \mathcal{G}(\xi(m) / N)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{G}(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    \text{const} & \text{if } x \to \infty, \\
    x^{-\beta/\nu} & \text{if } x \to 0.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

regime.}



\section{Exponent $\kappa$ and finite-entropy scaling}

In the asymptotically large $m$ regime, it is proven that the correlation length for
critical systems scales as
\begin{equation}
  \xi \propto m^{\kappa},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ depends only on the central charge of the phase transition
\cite{pollmann2009theory}. In \cite{tagliacozzo2008scaling}, the authors show that already
for modest $m$, this relation holds approximately.
