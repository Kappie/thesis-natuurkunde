Up until now, we have developed our scaling analysis in terms of a finite system size $N$.
But the approximation of the infinite-system partition function with the CTMRG algorithm depends on two parameters;
the system size $N$ and the bond dimension $m$.

A finite bond dimension $m$ carries a characteristic length scale.
Baxter \cite{baxter1978variational}, and later Ã–stlund and Rommer \cite{ostlund1995thermodynamic} (in the context of
one-dimensional quantum systems) showed that in the thermodynamic limit,
CTMRG and DMRG are variational optimizations in the space of matrix product states.
\todo[inline]{Can extend this idea a bit.}

It is known that an MPS-ansatz with finite bond dimension inherently limits the
correlation length of the system to a finite value \cite{wolf2006quantum, rommer1997class}. Hence,
thermodynamic quantities obtained from the CTMRG algorithm with finite $m$, in the limit
$N \to \infty$, cannot diverge and must show finite-size effects similar to those of some
effective finite system of size $N_{\text{eff}}(m)$ depending on the bond dimension $m$.

\autoref{fig:order_parameter_vs_T} shows the behaviour of the order parameter of the
two-dimensional Ising model for systems of finite-size,
where the result is converged in $m$, and for systems of finite $m$, where
the result is converged in the system size $N$. The results look very similar and support
the claim that there are two relevant length scales in the critical region, namely the system size $N$ and
the length scale associated to the finite bond dimension $m$.

\section{Definition of the effective length scale in terms of the correlation length at $T_c$}\label{sec:definition_effective_length_scale_in_terms_of_xi}

The first direct comparison of finite-size scaling in the system size $N$ with scaling in
the bond dimension of the CTMRG method $m$ was done
in \cite{nishino1996numerical}.

In the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite $m$ and $N$), we have the following
expression for the correlation length of a classical system
\cite{baxter1982exactly_correlation_length}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correlation_length_row_to_row_transfer_matrix}
  \xi(T) = \frac{1}{\log\left(\frac{T_0}{T_1}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Here, $T_0$ and $T_1$ are the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the row-to-row
transfer matrix $T$, respectively. With $N$ tending towards infinity and finite $m$, near
the critical point $\xi(T)$ should obey a scaling law of the form
\begin{equation}
  \xi(T, m) = N_{\text{eff}}(m) \mathcal{F}(N_{\text{eff}}(m) / \xi(T))
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}(x) = \begin{cases}
      \text{const} & \text{if } x \to 0, \\
      x^{-1} & \text{if } x \to \infty.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Hence, the effective length scale corresponding to the finite bond dimension $m$ is
proportional to the correlation length of the system at the critical point $t = 0$.
\begin{equation}
  N_{\text{eff}}(m) \propto \xi(T = T_c, m).
\end{equation}

\todo[inline]{Look ahead to replicating this in results section?}

\section{Relation to finite-entropy scaling and the exponent $\kappa$.}


The first numerical evidence of a law for the correlation length at the critical point of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xi_propto_m_kappa}
  \xi(m) \propto m^{\kappa}
\end{equation}
was given by the authors of \cite{andersson1999density}, who found
\begin{equation}
  \kappa \approx 1.3
\end{equation}
for a gapless system of free fermions, using DMRG calculations. Later, using the iTEBD algorithm
\cite{vidal2007classical}, the authors of \cite{tagliacozzo2008scaling} presented numerical evidence for such a relation
for the Ising model with transverse field and the Heisenberg model, with
\begin{align}
  \kappa_{\text{Ising}} & \approx 2, \\
  \kappa_{\text{Heisenberg}} & \approx 1.37.
\end{align}

\subsection{Quantitative theory for $\kappa$}
A quantitative theory of the existence of an exponent $\kappa$ was given in \cite{pollmann2009theory}.
We reproduce the argument, which is presented in the language of one-dimensional quantum systems, below.

We start by noting that in the critical region, the entanglement of a half-infinite subsystem $A$ diverges as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:entropy_scaling_near_criticality}
  S_A \propto \mathcal{A}(c/6)\log(\xi),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{A}$ is the number of boundary points of $A$ and $c$ is the central charge of the conformal field theory
at the critical point \cite{calabrese2004entanglement, vidal2003entanglement, ercolessi2010exact}.

Recalling the definition of the entanglement entropy
\begin{equation}
  S_A = - \tr(\rho_A \log \rho_A) = - \sum_{\alpha} \omega_{\alpha} \log \omega_{\alpha},
\end{equation}
it is trivially seen that the entropy of a state given by the DMRG (or any other MPS), which only
retains $m$ basis states of $\rho_A$, is limited by
\begin{equation}
  S^{\text{max}}_A(m) = \log m
\end{equation}
by putting $\omega_{\alpha} = 1/m$ for $\alpha = 1, \dots, m$.

This is, incidentally, another way to see that DMRG or CTMRG, or any other algorithm which produces ground states with a
matrix-product structure have an inherently finite correlation length.

The leading energy correction to the free energy per site of a one-dimensional quantum system at a conformally invariant
critical point at finite temperature $T$ in the thermodynamic limit is \cite{affleck1986universal}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_temperature}
  f(T) = f_0 + aT^2 + \mathcal{O}(T^3).
\end{equation}

Due to the quantum-classical correspondence, this is equivalent to a two-dimensional classical $N \times \infty$ lattice
with strip width $N = 1/T$.
This implies also that the correlation length of a critical one-dimensional quantum system at finite temperature cannot
diverge and goes as $\xi \propto 1/T$.
In terms of this finite correlation length, \autoref{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_temperature} is
written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_correlation_length}
  f(\xi) = f_{\infty} + \frac{A}{\xi^2} + \mathcal{O(\frac{1}{\xi^3})}.
\end{equation}

Empirically, optimized ground states with a matrix-product structure at criticality do not simply maximize their
entropy, as they should if we take \autoref{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_correlation_length} to be
true for ground states with a matrix-product structure.

We will now show that \autoref{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_correlation_length} needs,
in fact, an additional term due to the matrix-product structure with finite bond dimension $m$.

The ground state with finite correlation length and energy density as in
\autoref{eq:correction_free_energy_critical_point_finite_correlation_length} has a Schmidt decomposition that in
principle can have infinitely many terms
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ground_state_infinite_schmidt_decomposition}
  \ket{\psi_0} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \lambda_n \ket{\psi_{n}^{L}}\ket{\psi_{n}^{R}},
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi_{n}^{L}}$ and $\ket{\psi_{n}^{R}}$ are states of the left and right infinite half-chains. Normalization
requires
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n}^{\infty} \lambda_{n}^2 = 1.
\end{equation}

The ground state with a matrix-product structure with finite bond dimension $m$ has an additional constraint:
its Schmidt decomposition carries only the $m$ $\ket{\psi_n}$ with largest $\lambda_n$.
It is written as
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}}} = \frac{\sum_{n = 1}^{m} \lambda_n
  \ket{\psi_{n}^{L}}\ket{\psi_{n}^{R}}}{\sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^{m} \lambda_{n}^2}}.
\end{equation}

To find the extra energy cost of only keeping the first $m$ terms in the Schmidt decomposition,
note that in the limit of $m$ large, $\ket{\psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}}}$ almost entirely overlaps with $\ket{\psi_0}$,
hence can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}}} = \sqrt{1 - \epsilon^2} \ket{\psi_0} + \epsilon \ket{\psi_{\text{ex}}},
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi_{\text{ex}}}$ is some excited state and $\epsilon \ll 1$. This leads to an energy of
\begin{equation}
  E_{0}^{\text{MPS}} = \braket{\psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}} | \hat{H} | \psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}}} = E_0 + \epsilon^2 (E_{\text{ex}} - E_0),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon^2 = \left(1 - \braket{\psi_0 | \psi_{0}^{\text{MPS}}}^2 \right) = 1 - \sum_{n = 1}^{m} \lambda_{n}^2 \equiv
  P_{\text{res}}(m).
\end{equation}
Here, we have defined the residual probability $P_{\text{res}}$, also known as the truncation error,
as the part of the spectrum that is thrown away.

If we now assume that $E_0 - E_{\text{ex}}$ is proportional to the energy gap $\Delta$, which scales as \cite{lieb1961two, mata1989energy, pfeuty1970one}
\begin{equation}
  \Delta \propto \frac{1}{\xi},
\end{equation}
we arrive at
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correction_energy_mps_ground_state}
  E_{0}^{\text{MPS}} = E_{\infty} + \frac{A}{\xi^2} + \frac{B P_{\text{res}}(m)}{\xi}.
\end{equation}

It is clear that when the correlation length is very large, by \autoref{eq:entropy_scaling_near_criticality} the entropy
and $P_{\text{res}}(m)$ must be too.
So, the third term in \autoref{eq:correction_energy_mps_ground_state} dominates.

If the correlation length is small, the second term dominates.
The correlation length that belongs to the MPS ground state with fixed $m$ is the optimum that minimizes this
expression.

The details of the calculation, which can be found in the supplementary material of \cite{pollmann2009theory},
depend on the asymptotic form of $P_{\text{res}}$, found in \cite{calabrese2008entanglement}. In the limit $m \to \infty$, the correlation is indeed of the form in \autoref{eq:xi_propto_m_kappa} with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exact_value_kappa}
  \kappa = \frac{6}{c \left( \sqrt{12/c} + 1 \right) },
\end{equation}
which is in good agreement with the values found in \cite{tagliacozzo2008scaling}.

\section{Locating the critical point with the entanglement spectrum}\label{sec:locating_critical_point_entanglement}
Since phase transitions of quantum systems can be located by studying their entanglement spectrum
\cite{huang2017holographic, osborne2002entanglement}, classical systems may be investigated in the same way through the
correspondence in \autoref{eq:correspondence_density_matrix_ctm}.
This is an alternative to the usual approach of studying an order parameter or derivatives of thermodynamical
observables.

Examples of studies using the spectrum of the corner transfer matrix to analyze two-dimensional classical systems are
\cite{krvcmar2015reentrant, PhysRevE.94.022134, krvcmar2016phase}.

At the critical point, the entropy must diverge (cf.
\autoref{eq:entropy_scaling_near_criticality}).
For finite systems the entropy will remain finite, but the pseudocritical temperature $T^{\star}$ is defined as the
point of maximum entropy.
The critical point is then located by fitting the scaling law in \autoref{eq:scaling_law_T_star}.
