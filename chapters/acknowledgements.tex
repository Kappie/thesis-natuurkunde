I want to thank Philippe Corboz for all his help during the past year.
Thanks for being always enthusiastic and ready to answer questions, for including me in the group from the start,
and for showing me the messy reality of research.

Thanks to Piotr Czarnik, Sangwoo Chung, Schelto Crone, Karel Temmink and Ido Niesen for many helpful discussions.
Especially Ido, who took more time for me than could reasonably be expected for someone with such a busy schedule.

Thanks to Bernard Nienhuis, for very helpful discussions towards the end of my thesis.

Thanks to Tobias Bouma, for good times and for sharing your arcane knowledge of LaTeX.

Thanks to Boris Ponsioen for the hours and hours we spent drinking coffee,
discussing the intricacies of this-or-that algorithm or our next career move.
Those significantly broadened my perspective.

Thanks to Daan Mulder for our discussions about physics, politics and music.
If I remembered one line of a song, you could always declaim the whole verse,
at least in the case of Cohen (may he rest in peace).

Thanks to my family, whom I didn't see much the past year. And finally, thanks to Marianne.
