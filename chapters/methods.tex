We report the convergence behaviour of the algorithms and discuss validity and sources of error.

\section{Convergence criteria}

\subsection{Simulations with finite bond dimension}
The convergence of the CTMRG algorithm with fixed bond dimension $m$ (the infinite system algorithm) can be defined
in multiple ways (\emph{cite}). In this thesis, the convergence after step $i$ of the algorithm is defined as
\begin{equation}
  c_i = \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{m} | s_{\alpha}^{(i)} - s_{\alpha}^{(i - 1)} |,
\end{equation}
where $s_{\alpha}$ are the singular values of the corner transfer matrix $A$. If the convergence falls below some
threshold $\epsilon$, the algorithm terminates.

The assumption is that once the singular values stop changing to some precision, the optimal projection is sufficiently
close to its fixed point and the transfer matrices $A$ and $T$ represent an environment only limited by the length scale
given by $m$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \xi(m) \ll N
\end{equation}
is satisfied.

The convergence of the order parameter of the Ising model is shown in
\autoref{fig:convergence_order_parameter_finite_chi}.

\subsection{Simulations with finite system size}
In the finite-system algorithm, we require
\begin{equation}
  N \ll \xi(m),
\end{equation}
so the question becomes at which $m$ the results are sufficiently converged in $m$. Throughout this work, we have used
the residual probability (also called truncation error)
\begin{equation}
  P(m)^{(i)} = \frac{\sum_{\alpha = m + 1}^{dm} (s_{\alpha}^{(i)})^2 }{ \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{dm} (s_{\alpha}^{(i)})^2 },
\end{equation}
which quantifies the fraction of the spectrum of the corner transfer matrix that is thrown away, as a measure of how
accurate the transfer matrices represent the finite system of size $N$. Here, $d$ is the
dimension of the local tensors ($d = 2$ for the Ising model).

If, for a given $m$, we have
\begin{equation}
  P(m) < P_{\text{max}}
\end{equation}
we deem the result accurate enough.

In the limit $m \to d^n$, with
\begin{equation}
  n = \frac{N - 1}{2}
\end{equation}
the number of algorithm steps, we obtain the exact result for the transfer matrices and hence the partition function,
i.e. $P(m) \to 0$.

To justify that for small enough $P_{\max}$, we obtain good results for a wide range of $N$, figure bla bla.
